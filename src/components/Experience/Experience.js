              I had only dipped into HTML and CSS on Websites like MySpace. Good
              old MySpace. I had also taught myself a lot of Python. Eventually,
              I came across Kenzie Academy. Here, I learned the fundamentals of
              Front End Developement. Survived a rigorous 6-month course while
              also working full time at Swire Coca-Cola.

            <p>
              I finished the Front End Developement course in January 2021. Soon
              after, I started the Back End course. From here on, I started
              doing a lot more Full Stack developement. I have learned many
              fundamentals and structures from Kenzie Academy.
